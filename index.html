  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I attend the 10th grade in Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School, my name is William Cheng. I'm studying Digital Design and AP Computer Principles this year. I know there aren't many students that can take computer classes at this school. So I am really glad I am able to get this chance learning computer science. I'm hoping that I could exceed in the methods of website creating. I can't wait to learn how to code. I'm aware that not everything will be simple, but I am willing to face the problems. I really like web development too, it's one of my favorite classes, behind math and chemistry. So I am very happy to be in such an awesome class. I will try my best to use my skills to the best and earn new ones.</p>
